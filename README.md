Google_FooBar_Challenge
===

This repository consists of a selection of python files I submitted for the Google FooBar challenge. I tried to include the problem statement in the code for reference. Most of the files don't have comments because of the time limitations of the challenge, but I tried to add comments if I could. 

The challenge was a lot of fun to complete!
